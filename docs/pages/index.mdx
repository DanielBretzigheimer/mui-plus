import CodeExample from 'nextra-theme-mui-docs/CodeExample';

# Mui+

A set of opinionated components on top of the excellent [`material-ui`](https://material-ui.com/) library, intended to enable creating richer data visualization.

## Showcase

import Weather from '../examples/DataGrid/Weather';
import srcWeather from '../examples/DataGrid/Weather?raw';

<CodeExample src={srcWeather}>
  <Weather />
</CodeExample>

## Disclaimer

This is just a toy project I started to get a better understanding of how to build complex components on top of the Material UI library and to explore alternative implementations.

This library comes with no guarantees, you are free to use it but if you need any of

- support
- bug fixes or feature requests
- strict semver adherence
- proper documentation
- API stability

please head on over to [`Material UI`](https://material-ui.com/).
