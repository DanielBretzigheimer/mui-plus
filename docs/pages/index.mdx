# mui-plus

A set of opinionated components intended to complement the [`material-ui`](https://material-ui.com/) library.

**Note:** This project's main reason for existence is to scratch a personal itch and educational purposes. You are free to use this code, but it comes without any guarantees. If you're looking for a well supported datagrid, please take a look at the [Material UI `DataGrid`](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/).
